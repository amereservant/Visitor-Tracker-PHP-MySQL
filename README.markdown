Simple PHP Visitor Tracking
-----------------------------------

**Simple PHP Visitor Tracking** is a very basic PHP script for tracking visitor activity by IP address.

It is a derivative of the [Visitor-Tracker-PHP-MySQL](https://github.com/solarisedesign/Visitor-Tracker-PHP-MySQL) by solarisedesign in which I converted to use the PHP PDO library and SQLite database driver.

How It Works
------------------

To see the script in action:

1. Visit any/all of the pages:
    * visitor_tracking_page1.php
    * visitor_tracking_page2.php
    * visitor_tracking_page3.php

2. View the results by visiting ip_report.php

Feel free to use this code for whatever purpose, or more formally, in accordance with the MIT license.
